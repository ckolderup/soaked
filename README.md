# What the what??

[Bukkit](http://bukkit.org) is a custom server for Minecraft multiplayer.

[Splash](http://soaked-demo.heroku.com/) is a plugin for Bukkit that sends HTTP requests to remote servers when in-game events occur.

*Soaked* is a demo webapp that receives events from Bukkit's Splash and displays them to visitors as they occur.

There is [a live demo of soaked](http://soaked-demo.heroku.com/).
